    Project: Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts
    Version: 2.0
    Description: Basic HTML/CSS practice exercise provided by CodeAcademy. But, with flex box
    to make the page a little more responsive and modern. The plan is to still stay true to the
    original style specification - with some small changes.
